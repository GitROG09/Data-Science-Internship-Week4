🌦️ Weather Data Analysis — Week 4

Internship: The Developers Arena
Domain: Data Science
Duration: 2 Months
Week: 4 — Data Visualization & Complete Project

📌 Objective

To analyze monthly weather trends (Temperature, Rainfall, and Humidity) and visualize them using Matplotlib in Python. The goal is to understand seasonal changes and relationships between variables through clear and effective data visualization.

🧮 Dataset Description

The dataset contains weather information for each month of the year, including:

Month: January to December

Temperature (°C): Monthly average temperature

Rainfall (mm): Monthly total rainfall

Humidity (%): Average humidity percentage

📊 Visualizations Created

Line Chart: Monthly temperature trend

Bar Chart: Monthly rainfall distribution

Pie Chart: Humidity percentage comparison

Combined Chart: Temperature vs Rainfall (dual-axis comparison)

💡 Key Insights

Temperature gradually increases from January to June, peaking during summer, then decreases towards December.

Rainfall is highest in July and August, clearly indicating the monsoon season.

Humidity levels are also highest during monsoon months, aligning with rainfall peaks.

The combined chart highlights an inverse relationship between rainfall and temperature during the rainy season.

🧠 Conclusion

Data visualization helps identify seasonal weather patterns and understand how temperature, rainfall, and humidity interact.
This analysis can be useful for climate studies, agriculture planning, and environmental insights.
